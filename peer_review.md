# Peer Review
### Author:  [Jordan](https://github.com/JfromNWMS)
### Review:  Linsay Foster - [Regression Analysis](https://github.com/LFoster03/ml_regression_foster/blob/main/regression_foster.ipynb)

1) Clarity & Organization

    Linsay Foster's final project was highly organized with proper section headings, section comments and code annotations.  The notebook was organized in a manner that made the steps the author was executing easy to follow.  The only suggestion I have for the analyst would be to include the Pearson correlation coeficients in their correlation heatmap so the reader knows both the strength and direction of the relationships.
2) Feature Selection & Justification

    The input model features indeed make sense in predicting Charges based upon the analysts EDA findings.  They all reflect features that showed a response to the target feature. 
3) Model Performance & Comparisons

    The author did an excellent job in explaining and comparing the results of the models.  The author went to extra lengths in order to be sure readers of all backgrounds can understand what all the performance metrics mean by explaining their context.
4) Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

    All reflections were very well thought out.  The reflections provided insights into the dataset and the models' performance by well-elaborated explanations of the performance metrics obtained by the models.
