### Author:  [Jordan](https://github.com/JfromNWMS)
### Review:  Linsay Foster - [Mushroom Classification Project](https://github.com/LFoster03/ml-midterm-foster/blob/main/classification_foster.ipynb)

1) Clarity & Organization

    Linsay Foster's midterm project was highly organized with proper section headings, section comments and code annotations.  The notebook was organized in a manner that made the steps the author was executing easy to follow.  The only suggestion I have in regard to organization and clarity is to give the reader a bit of background on the dataset itself in the introduction, such as what kinds of mushrooms are included in the dataset itself.
2) Feature Selection & Justification

    The input model features of 'odor', 'cap_look', and 'stalk-root' indeed make sense in predicting edibility.  They all reflect features that are historically known in predicting the edibility of a mushroom. 
3) Model Performance & Comparisons

    The author did an excellent job in explaining and comparing the results of the models.  The author went to extra lengths in order to be sure readers of all backgrounds can understand what all the performance metrics mean by explaining their context.
4) Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

    All reflections were very well thought out.  The reflections provided insights into the dataset and the models' performance by well-elaborated explanations of the performance metrics obtained by the models.  The final reflection was particularly worth noting due to comprehensive list of the learning objectives of the project.
